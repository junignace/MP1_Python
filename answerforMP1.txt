The graph is increasing until it reached its peak value when it is at the interval of 9.
After that interval it starts again with the same value that it has in the beggining until
it also reached the same value that the interval 9 had. It continued to repeat until it 
finished its interval 100. The reason for this is because the piecewise function did not
allow a value of the variable greater that 9. It will continue to subtract until it became
a value which fits the first condition thus making the graph repeated.
